# CyberTickets

The purpose of this project is to show the importance of service ticket history and the ability to analyze tickets and employee performance quickly.

For example, a company prints ticket statuses weekly to share with the team so sales reps are informed about technical problems their accounts are experiencing.  The only way to track the history of a problem is to compare these weekly reports, which is cumbersome and time-intensive.  A simple site with a searchable ticket history would make this process much faster and more thorough.  Also, with this increased visibility, it may help improve the troubleshooting process and hopefully fix the problem before a customer begins to question why they purchased from the example company to begin with.  

Here is an example of Cybersecurity Tickets from kaggle.com that demonstrates what is needed:
